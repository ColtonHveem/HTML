  <p>This is a paragraph of text. Let's pretend it's part of a long article, where we expect many people to quickly scan through it and we want to mark <b>certain phrases with some boldness</b>, some visual attention, so that those sentences jump out and poepl don't miss them. Almost like having a pull-quote.</p>

<blockquote><p>We've gone from having 21 elements in HTML tages, that first document, to having 100 more elements now, and yet it's still the same language. I find that amazing. It's still the same language that was created 25 years ago. It's grown as extra 100 elements in there, and yet itj's still the same language.</p>
